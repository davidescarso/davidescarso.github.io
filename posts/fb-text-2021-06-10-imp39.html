<p>E ainda dizem que o capitalismo fóssil não tem imaginação.
«"I understand from what’s been testified to the Forest Service and the BLM [Bureau of Land Management], you want very much to work on the issue of climate change," Gohmert said, adding that a past director of Nasa had once told him that orbits of the moon and the Earth were indeed changing.
"We know there’s been significant solar flare activity, and so … is there anything that the National Forest Service or BLM can do to change the course of the moon’s orbit, or the Earth’s orbit around the sun?" Gohmert asked. "Obviously that would have profound effects on our climate."
Eberlien [associate deputy chief of the US Forest Service] said she would have to "follow up with you on that one, Mr Gohmert."
"Well, if you figure out a way that you in the Forest Service can make that change, I’d like to know," Gohmert added. »</p>
