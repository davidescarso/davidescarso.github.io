<p>Declaration of Support for the Lisbon Climate Strike Students on Trial
More power to the Portuguese students and global Climate Strike movement! Everyone should go on strike, not just students! When many of us protested against acid rain, whaling and nuclear weapons in the 70s and 80s, we knew these things were bad and needed changing, but that did seem at least doable. Climate change was almost not discussed then. Maybe it never seemed urgent enough – or perhaps it was just too complex, or as it turns out, a lot of evidence was being hidden from us. It must make you rightfully angry to have grown up now during a time when global climate change and all the terrible consequences associated with it have been known about for decades, yet the same old push for growth and use of fossil fuels has never really relented.</p>
<p>It makes us angry too. On top of that, respectable, well-educated people in power seem to have been complicit in going along with it all for decades. It must be discouraging. And still you have politicians and administrators who openly say that if you go along with climate strikes and any form of anti-growth protests for a fairer world, a global justice agenda, you are pretty much an enemy of the state. As your José Saramago once said “There are plenty of reasons not to put up with the world as it is” – and wanting a less damaged planet to live on really should not be such a big ask. You are not alone!</p>
<p>The undersigned support your right to draw attention to this global issue. Fill this form to sign this declaration:
