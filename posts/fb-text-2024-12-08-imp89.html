<p>« There's something like 13 million phones thrown out every day, which is a crazy, mind-boggling number. And if you think about that in aggregate, it's that we're all replacing these things every two or three years. Even though they are incredibly advanced and expensive, and in some ways almost the pinnacle of our industrial capability as a civilization, they are basically throwaway objects. And so, I look at that and I think, that's really broken, that's broken across every possible way that you can look at it. »</p>
